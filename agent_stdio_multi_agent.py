"""
This script demonstrates how to create a multi-agent orchestration system using Strands Agents and integrate with an MCP server.
It integrates with an external MCP server using STDIO transport protocol to search for images on Shutterstock.com.
It also uses the 'Agents as Tools' architectural pattern to retrieve weather information from the National Weather Service API.
It also uses a Bedrock model for natural language processing and a conversation manager to handle interactions.

1. Based on the city and state, get the latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. Use those coordinates with the following URL template: https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}
3. Then use the returned forecast URL to get the actual forecast

When displaying weather responses:
- Provide a single, concise sentence summarizing the actual current weather in that location.
- Do not include numerical details like temperature, wind speed, or humidity.
- Do not include the city or state name in the response; focus on the weather conditions only.
- Do not start with "The weather is" or similar phrases.
- Use natural language to describe the weather, e.g., "It is sunny with a chance of rain later."
- Example responses: "Cloudy with a chance of showers" or "Sunny and the sky is clear"
